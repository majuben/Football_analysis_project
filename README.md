# Football Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a **Python-based football video analysis pipeline** that processes match footage to detect and track players and the ball using **YOLO** and custom tracking modules.  
The workflow includes:
- **Camera movement estimation**
- **Player and ball detection**
- **Team assignment**
- **Object tracking**
- **Annotated video output**

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`main.py`** – Orchestrates the end-to-end video analysis pipeline.
- **`yolo_inference.py`** – Runs YOLO object detection on video frames.
- **`camera_movement_estimator/`** – Handles stabilization and detection of camera motion.
- **`player_ball_assigner/`** – Assigns detected objects (players vs. ball).
- **`team_assigner/`** – Differentiates teams and labels team identity.
- **`trackers/`** – Implements tracking logic for players and the ball.
- **`models/`** – Contains trained model files.
- **`training/`** – Scripts or notebooks for model training.
- **`input_videos/`** – Sample match footage to analyze.
- **`output_videos/`** – Annotated match videos generated by the pipeline.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/majuben/Football_analysis_project.git
   cd Football_analysis_project
```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Make sure to have **Python 3.8+** installed.
   > Common dependencies: `opencv-python`, `torch`, `numpy`, `yolov5` or similar.

3. **Prepare models**

   * Download or train YOLO model weights.
   * Place the `.pt` or `.onnx` file inside the `models/` directory.

---

## ▶️ Usage

To analyze a football match video:

```bash
python main.py --input input_videos/match.mp4 --output output_videos/annotated_match.mp4
```

### Optional Parameters

* `--confidence` → Detection confidence threshold.
* `--tracking` → Choose tracking algorithm (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT).
* `--display` → Show video output while processing.

---

## 📊 Training (Optional)

If you wish to train a new YOLO model for detection:

```bash
python training/train_model.py --data path/to/dataset.yaml --epochs 100 --batch-size 16
```

Dataset format should follow YOLO conventions.

---

## 📁 Results

Processed videos with **player IDs**, **ball tracking**, and **team labels** are saved in the `output_videos/` folder.
Example:

```
output_videos/
 ├── match_annotated.mp4
 └── match_analysis_summary.json
```
